------------------PHP library Readability LICENCE is BELOW----------------

/** 
* Arc90's Readability ported to PHP for FiveFilters.org
* Based on readability.js version 1.7.1 (without multi-page support)
* Updated to allow HTML5 parsing with html5lib
* Updated with lightClean mode to preserve more images and youtube/vimeo/viddler embeds
* Updated to allow HTML5 parsing with Gumbo PHP
* ------------------------------------------------------
* Original URL: http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/js/readability.js
* Arc90's project URL: http://lab.arc90.com/experiments/readability/
* JS Source: http://code.google.com/p/arc90labs-readability
* Ported by: Keyvan Minoukadeh, http://www.keyvan.net
* More information: http://fivefilters.org/content-only/
* License: Apache License, Version 2.0
* Requires: PHP5
* Date: 2017-02-05
* 
* Differences between the PHP port and the original
* ------------------------------------------------------
* Arc90's Readability is designed to run in the browser. It works on the DOM 
* tree (the parsed HTML) after the page's CSS styles have been applied and 
* Javascript code executed. This PHP port does not run inside a browser. 
* We use PHP's ability to parse HTML to build our DOM tree, but we cannot 
* rely on CSS or Javascript support. As such, the results will not always 
* match Arc90's Readability. (For example, if a web page contains CSS style 
* rules or Javascript code which hide certain HTML elements from display, 
* Arc90's Readability will dismiss those from consideration but our PHP port, 
* unable to understand CSS or Javascript, will not know any better.)
* 
* Another significant difference is that the aim of Arc90's Readability is 
* to re-present the main content block of a given web page so users can 
* read it more easily in their browsers. Correct identification, clean up, 
* and separation of the content block is only a part of this process. 
* This PHP port is only concerned with this part, it does not include code 
* that relates to presentation in the browser - Arc90 already do 
* that extremely well, and for PDF output there's FiveFilters.org's 
* PDF Newspaper: http://fivefilters.org/pdf-newspaper/.
* 
* Finally, this class contains methods that might be useful for developers 
* working on HTML document fragments. So without deviating too much from 
* the original code (which I don't want to do because it makes debugging 
* and updating more difficult), I've tried to make it a little more 
* developer friendly. You should be able to use the methods here on 
* existing DOMElement objects without passing an entire HTML document to 
* be parsed.
